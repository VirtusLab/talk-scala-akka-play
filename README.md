Scala, Akka and Play! framework
===============================

Introductory talk to Scala, Akka and Play! framework, done in 2013 by [Jerzy Müller](http://github.com/Kwestor) for a lecture on AGH University in Kraków.

Kudos to Bartek Szopka for his [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js).
